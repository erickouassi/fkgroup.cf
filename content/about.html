<p>Kouassi Savings Group (KoSaG) started in 2016. <br>
  What started as informal discussions and encouragement let to running of the Savings
  scheme where we put money away week by week or month by month until we had enough money saved to buy or spend it
  on what we wanted. <br>
  Please note: this is a family member only savings group.
